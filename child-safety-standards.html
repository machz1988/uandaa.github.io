    Child Safety & Protection Policy
1. Our Commitment

We have a zero-tolerance policy for Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE). Any attempt to share, create, request, or distribute child sexual abuse material (CSAM), engage in grooming, or exploit children in any way is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate account termination and reporting to the appropriate authorities.

2. Prohibited Conduct

Users may not:

Share or attempt to share CSAM or exploitative material.

Use the app to groom, solicit, or exploit minors in any way.

Exchange personally identifiable information (PII) of minors in unsafe contexts.

Encourage, promote, or normalize sexual activity with minors.

3. Age Requirements

Our app is not intended for people under 18.

We reserve the right to verify age and identity if misuse is suspected.

4. Content Monitoring & Detection

To protect children, we may use:

Automated detection tools (e.g., hash-matching, keyword detection, grooming pattern monitoring).

Human moderation to review flagged content.

Safe design defaults.

5. Reporting & Enforcement

In-app reporting tools are available so users can flag harmful or exploitative behavior.

All credible reports of CSAE will be escalated immediately.

Confirmed CSAE cases will be:

Reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the U.S. or equivalent organizations internationally.

Shared with law enforcement agencies as required by law.

6. User Responsibility

By using our app, you agree to:

Never upload, share, or request exploitative content.

Report any suspicious activity or harmful behavior immediately.

Respect the safety, privacy, and dignity of all users, especially minors.

7. Cooperation with Authorities

We cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies and child protection organizations in investigating and prosecuting CSAE.

8. Updates to Policy

We may update this policy as laws and best practices evolve. Users will be notified of major changes.
